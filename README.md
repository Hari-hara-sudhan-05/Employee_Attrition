# Employee Attrition Prediction with Explainable AI (XAI)

Welcome to the Employee Attrition Prediction project! This project aims to predict employee turnover using an XGBoost model while leveraging explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to interpret the model's predictions and offer actionable business insights.

Project Overview
Predicting employee attrition is a crucial task for businesses to retain their top talent and reduce turnover costs. This project uses a dataset of employee attributes to build a machine learning model, interpret its predictions, and provide explainable insights that help HR teams make informed decisions.

Key Features
Machine Learning Model: An XGBoost classifier is trained to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.
Explainable AI Techniques:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for global and local feature importance.
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for understanding individual predictions.
Data Visualization: Visual insights on features and model predictions.
React Web Application: A user interface to interact with the prediction model and explanations.
