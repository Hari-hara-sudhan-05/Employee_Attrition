# Employee Attrition Prediction with Explainable AI (XAI)

Welcome to the Employee Attrition Prediction project! This project aims to predict employee turnover using an XGBoost model while leveraging explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to interpret the model's predictions and offer actionable business insights.

## Project Overview  
Employee attrition can significantly impact an organization’s productivity, finances, and team morale. This project uses machine learning to predict which employees are at risk of leaving, providing actionable insights to improve employee retention. In addition to building a predictive model using XGBoost, we employ Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP and LIME to interpret the model’s outputs, ensuring HR decisions are transparent and understandable.

### Objectives:  
- Predict employee attrition based on various employee and job-related features.  
- Use XAI techniques to understand the model’s predictions.  
- Offer actionable recommendations based on interpretable insights.
